# IC_challenge

## The Challenge
Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, -- YES, I DO --, is to set up 
and maintain sustainable infrastructure for a web application with Ansible or 
Docker. We like people who are able to learn and research. Even if you might 
not get the tasks completed, write down the notes with desired solution. 

## My research process
- I started this challenge by making some studies about Docker
- Then, I tried to find out how to create a docker HAproxy and integrate it 
into a docker-compose file.  
- Did the same for the two other nodes (Django and Postgres) 
- I then assembled all the Docker container into the docker-compose file

## How to launch
From the _challenge_ directory, launch:  
```bash
docker compose up 
```
