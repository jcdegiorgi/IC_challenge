# IC_challenge

## The Challenge

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, YES, I DO, 
is to set up and maintain sustainable infrastructure for a 
web application with Ansible or Docker. We like people who are 
able to learn and research. Even if you might not get the tasks 
completed, write down the notes with desired solution. 
Your notes will help us in the evaluation of your work. 
We understand there's more than one way to do things. 
If you're stuck, pick one and justify your choice.


## My research process
Find out how to create a docker HAproxy and integrate it into
a docker-compose file.
Do the same for the two other nodes (Django and Postgres)
